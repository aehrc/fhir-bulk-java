## Usage

This example shows how to run system level export of Patient and Condition resources from the https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org/ demo server.

```java
    // the Fhir endpoint URL
    final String fhirEndpointUrl = "https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org/eyJlcnIiOiIiLCJwYWdlIjoxMDAwMCwiZHVyIjoxMCwidGx0IjoxNSwibSI6MSwic3R1Ijo0LCJkZWwiOjB9/fhir";
    
    // the directory where the exported files will be saved
    final String outputDir = "target/export-" + Instant.now().toEpochMilli();

    final BulkExportResult result = BulkExportClient.systemBuilder()
        .withFhirEndpointUrl(fhirEndpointUrl)
        .withOutputDir(outputDir)
        .withTypes(List.of("Patient", "Condition"))
        .build()
        .export();
    
    System.out.println(result);
